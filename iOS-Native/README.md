## Reference Implementations ##

- Many (as of this writing, all) of these iOS-Native components originally appeared in Salesforce for iPad, a free, unofficial, unsupported, open-source app that's [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ForceDotComLabs/Salesforce-for-iPad).

## Installation ##

0. These components have a *required dependency* on the [Force.com Mobile SDK for iOS](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS). First ensure you have it added to your app.
1. Grab the component source code: `git clone https://github.com/ForceDotCom/MobileComponents.git`
2. iOS Native components are in the iOS-Native directory. Copy the component(s) of your choice into your xcode project.

### Follow Button ###

![The FollowButton in Salesforce for iPad](https://github.com/forcedotcom/MobileComponents/raw/master/iOS-Native/Images/followbutton.png)

A `UIBarButtonItem` intended to make it easy to create a follow/unfollow toggle between the running user and any other user or Chatter-enabled record.

Usage:

1. Create a new button with the parent object's ID (the id of the user/record to follow/unfollow). Use the built-in constructor. `FollowButton *myFollowButton = [FollowButton followButtonWithParentId:@"00530000001emdl"];`
2. Set the follow button's delegate to your viewcontroller (`myFollowButton.delegate = self;`), add the `FollowButtonDelegate`to your viewcontroller's header, and add the button itself to your view.
3. Once your view has loaded, instruct your follow button to load its current follow state. `[myFollowButton loadFollowState];`
4. When the user taps the button, it will call your delegate with `followButtonWillChangeState` and `followButtonDidChangeState`. Salesforce for iPad uses these delegate events to swap out the `FollowButton` in favor of an activity loading spinner to indicate to the user that a network operation is in progress, but that's entirely optional. When the follow or unfollow action is completed, the button should update its state and displayed text.
